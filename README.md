Fun one, to get started. Still working out code organization.

Done! This one was funny, because it actually played on one of the 
things that upsets me most about coding: changing requirements and 
coding based on assumptions. In real life, I'd have not bothered 
with part 1, because it relied on me inferring requirements that, 
well, ended up being drastically wrong, and that _definitely_ 
affected the shape of the solution, especially considering that I 
needed both results.

In retrospect, I got it "right" but I'm really unhappy with the 
process of accomplishing that. I should have added a transformation 
step to migrate the two input specifications into a common form, and 
evaluated *that* - it would have simplified *everything*. The 
incomplete specs and the time factor (as I'm in a race with other 
coders) worked against that.
