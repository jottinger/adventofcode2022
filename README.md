Fun one, to get started. Still working out code organization.

Done! This one was funny, because it actually played on one of the 
things that upsets me most about coding: changing requirements and 
coding based on assumptions. In real life, I'd have not bothered 
with part 1, because it relied on me inferring requirements that, 
well, ended up being drastically wrong, and that _definitely_ 
affected the shape of the solution, especially considering that I 
needed both results.
